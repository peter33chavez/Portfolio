# Personal Portfolio
My Portfolio displays some projects as well as gives you a little background on who I am, and what to expect from me. 
Design for project was done in AdobeXD/Illustrator
I am using React for the main structure of this project with Firebase to handle the contact form data. 
I utilize ```useState``` within the project to handle dynamically populating of my projects, as well as ```useEffect``` for the Framer Motion animations. ```Props``` were also used for the titles and onClick property for the contact form.
## TOOLS: 
- React
- JavaScript
- Firebase

For cloning the project, all the dependencies are within the ```package.json``` file in the root directory. 

You will also need to ```create a Firebase project``` in order to allow the contact form to work. 

Once you download all the dependencies, run ```npm start``` to run on your local host.
