                    <p>Hello! Peter here, a Frontend Web Developer with experience in design and Backend Development. Iâ€™ve been working in Tech Sales my whole career and made the pivot to the Development field because of my passion for creating. I bring an idiosyncratic angle to development with my business/analytical mindset, which allows me to have the companies best interests in mind.</p>
